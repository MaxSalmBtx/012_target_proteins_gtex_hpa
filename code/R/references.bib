  abstract        = {Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a standard method for spatial proteomics and allows for exploration of protein expression at single-cell resolution within the intact tissue environment. Stringent procedures and proper antibody validation strategies are however needed to ensure reliability of results. Application-specific strategies have been proposed by the scientific community to ensure high quality despite variations in sample preparation between different antibody-based methods. Here, the entire workflow utilized within the Human Protein Atlas, from sample preparation to annotation of the IHC staining patterns is described in detail, with important notes on various factors that can affect the outcome of IHC. Methods include tissue microarray (TMA) production, tissue sectioning, IHC, annotation, and validation. Also, building on previously suggested validation strategies, IHC-specific orthogonal and independent validation methods are outlined.},

Access of the HPA data is mainly via web-based interface allowing views of individual proteins, which may not be optimal for data analysis of a gene set, or automatic retrieval of original images. HPAanalyze is an R package for retrieving and performing exploratory analysis of data from HPA. HPAanalyze provides functionality for importing data tables and xml files from HPA, exporting and visualizing data, as well as downloading all staining images of interest. The package is free, open source, and available via Bioconductor and GitHub. We provide examples of the use of HPAanalyze to investigate proteins altered in the deadly brain tumor glioblastoma. For example, we confirm Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor elevation and Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog loss and suggest the importance of the GTP Cyclohydrolase I/Tetrahydrobiopterin pathway. Additionally, we provide an interactive website for non-programmers to explore and visualize data without the use of R. HPAanalyze integrates into the R workflow with the tidyverse framework, and it can be used in combination with Bioconductor packages for easy analysis of HPA data.},

Mapping the in situ localization of 12,003 human proteins at a single-cell level to 30 subcellular structures enabled the definition of the proteomes of 13 major organelles. Exploration of the proteomes revealed single-cell variations in abundance or spatial distribution and localization of about half of the proteins to multiple compartments. This subcellular map can be used to refine existing protein-protein interaction networks and provides an important resource to deconvolute the highly complex architecture of the human cell.},

Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of proteins predicted to be secreted in human cells, which provides information about their final localization in the human body, including the proteins actively secreted to peripheral blood. The analysis suggests that a large number of the proteins of the secretome are not secreted out of the cell, but instead are retained intracellularly, whereas another large group of proteins were identified that are predicted to be retained locally at the tissue of expression and not secreted into the blood. Proteins detected in the human blood by mass spectrometry-based proteomics and antibody-based immunoassays are also presented with estimates of their concentrations in the blood. The results are presented in an updated version 19 of the Human Protein Atlas in which each gene encoding a secretome protein is annotated to provide an open-access knowledge resource of the human secretome, including body-wide expression data, spatial localization data down to the single-cell and subcellular levels, and data about the presence of proteins that are detectable in the blood.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we aimed to identify tissue-specific genes for various human tissues/organs more robustly and rigorously by extending the tau score algorithm. Tissue-specific genes are a class of genes whose functions and expressions are preferred in one or several tissues restrictedly. Identification of tissue-specific genes is essential for discovering multi-cellular biological processes such as tissue-specific molecular regulations, tissue development, physiology, and the pathogenesis of tissue-associated diseases. Gene expression data derived from five large RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) projects, spanning 96 different human tissues, were retrieved from ArrayExpress and ExpressionAtlas. The first step is categorizing genes using significant filters and tau score as a specificity index. After calculating tau for each gene in all datasets separately, statistical distance from the maximum expression level was estimated using a new meaningful procedure. Specific expression of a gene in one or several tissues was calculated after the integration of tau and statistical distance estimation, which is called as extended tau approach. Obtained tissue-specific genes for 96 different human tissues were functionally annotated, and some comparisons were carried out to show the effectiveness of the extended tau method. Categorization of genes based on expression level and identification of tissue-specific genes for a large number of tissues/organs were executed. Genes were successfully assigned to multiple tissues by generating the extended tau approach as opposed to the original tau score, which can assign tissue specificity to single tissue only.},

The present study aims to establish a solid association between gene expression and patient survival outcomes to enhance the utility of the Human Pathology Atlas for cancer research. In this updated analysis, we examined the expression profiles of 6918 patients across 21 cancer types. We integrated data from 10 independent cancer cohorts, creating a cross-validated, reliable collection of prognostic genes. We applied systems biology approach to identify the association between gene expression profiles and patient survival outcomes. We further constructed prognostic regulatory networks for kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), which elucidate the molecular underpinnings associated with patient survival in these cancers. We observed that gene expression during the transition from normal to tumorous tissue exhibited diverse shifting patterns in their original tissue locations. Significant correlations between gene expression and patient survival outcomes were identified in KIRC and LIHC among the major cancer types. Additionally, the prognostic regulatory network established for these two cancers showed the indicative capabilities of the Human Pathology Atlas and provides actionable insights for cancer research. The updated Human Pathology Atlas provides a significant foundation for precision oncology and the formulation of personalized treatment strategies. These findings deepen our understanding of cancer biology and have the potential to advance targeted therapeutic approaches in clinical practice.

  abstract        = {This article presents global cancer statistics by world region for the year 2022 based on updated estimates from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). There were close to 20 million new cases of cancer in the year 2022 (including nonmelanoma skin cancers [NMSCs]) alongside 9.7 million deaths from cancer (including NMSC). The estimates suggest that approximately one in five men or women develop cancer in a lifetime, whereas around one in nine men and one in 12 women die from it. Lung cancer was the most frequently diagnosed cancer in 2022, responsible for almost 2.5 million new cases, or one in eight cancers worldwide (12.4% of all cancers globally), followed by cancers of the female breast (11.6%), colorectum (9.6%), prostate (7.3%), and stomach (4.9%). Lung cancer was also the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths (18.7%), followed by colorectal (9.3%), liver (7.8%), female breast (6.9%), and stomach (6.8%) cancers. Breast cancer and lung cancer were the most frequent cancers in women and men, respectively (both cases and deaths). Incidence rates (including NMSC) varied from four-fold to five-fold across world regions, from over 500 in Australia/New Zealand (507.9 per 100,000) to under 100 in Western Africa (97.1 per 100,000) among men, and from over 400 in Australia/New Zealand (410.5 per 100,000) to close to 100 in South-Central Asia (103.3 per 100,000) among women. The authors examine the geographic variability across 20 world regions for the 10 leading cancer types, discussing recent trends, the underlying determinants, and the prospects for global cancer prevention and control. With demographics-based predictions indicating that the number of new cases of cancer will reach 35 million by 2050, investments in prevention, including the targeting of key risk factors for cancer (including smoking, overweight and obesity, and infection), could avert millions of future cancer diagnoses and save many lives worldwide, bringing huge economic as well as societal dividends to countries over the forthcoming decades.},

However, leveraging GraphQL for data retrieval can be challenging, time-consuming, and repetitive, requiring familiarity with the GraphQL query language and processing outputs in nested JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format into tidy data tables. Therefore, developing open-source tools are required to simplify data retrieval processes to integrate valuable genetic information into data-driven target discovery pipelines seamlessly. otargen is an open-source R package designed to make data retrieval and analysis from the Open Target Genetics portal as simple as possible for R users. The package offers a suite of functions covering all query types, allowing streamlined data access in a tidy table format.

Although many important discoveries have been made by TCGA's research network, opportunities still exist to implement novel methods, thereby elucidating new biological pathways and diagnostic markers. However, mining the TCGA data presents several bioinformatics challenges, such as data retrieval and integration with clinical data and other molecular data types (e.g. RNA and DNA methylation). We developed an R/Bioconductor package called TCGAbiolinks to address these challenges and offer bioinformatics solutions by using a guided workflow to allow users to query, download and perform integrative analyses of TCGA data. We combined methods from computer science and statistics into the pipeline and incorporated methodologies developed in previous TCGA marker studies and in our own group. Using four different TCGA tumor types (Kidney, Brain, Breast and Colon) as examples, we provide case studies to illustrate examples of reproducibility, integrative analysis and utilization of different Bioconductor packages to advance and accelerate novel discoveries.},

However, beyond immunohistochemistry, proteins are not typically measured in precision oncology, meaning transcriptomics is used as a proxy. To determine how informative mRNA is for guiding personalised treatments, mRNA-protein correlations were analysed in three large pan-cancer datasets and made available in a web portal (https://procan.shinyapps.io/OnCorr/).

  abstract        = {A major goal of biomedical research is to identify molecular features associated with a biological or clinical class of interest. Differential expression analysis has long been used for this purpose; however, conventional methods perform poorly when applied to data with high within class heterogeneity. To address this challenge, we developed EMDomics, a new method that uses the Earth mover's distance to measure the overall difference between the distributions of a gene's expression in two classes of samples and uses permutations to obtain q-values for each gene. We applied EMDomics to the challenging problem of identifying genes associated with drug resistance in ovarian cancer. We also used simulated data to evaluate the performance of EMDomics, in terms of sensitivity and specificity for identifying differentially expressed gene in classes with high within class heterogeneity. In both the simulated and real biological data, EMDomics outperformed competing approaches for the identification of differentially expressed genes, and EMDomics was significantly more powerful than conventional methods for the identification of drug resistance-associated gene sets. EMDomics represents a new approach for the identification of genes differentially expressed between heterogeneous classes and has utility in a wide range of complex biomedical conditions in which sample classes show within class heterogeneity.

The confidence score of a given document represents how valuable the document is in the scope of target validation for a given target-disease association by taking into account the credibility of the association based on the properties of the text. The component serves the platform regularly with the up-to-date data since December, 2015. Currently, there are a total number of 1168365 distinct target-disease associations text mined from >26 million PubMed abstracts and >1.2 million Open Access full text articles. Our comparative analyses on the current available evidence data in the platform revealed that 850179 of these associations are exclusively identified by literature mining. This component helps the platform's users by providing the most relevant literature hits for a given target and disease. The text mining evidence along with the other types of evidence can be explored visually through https://www.targetvalidation.org and all the evidence data is available for download in json format from https://www.targetvalidation.org/downloads/data .},

In this context, we have completely revamped our target-disease associations page with more interactive facets and built-in functionalities to empower users with additional control over their experience using the Platform, and added a new Target Prioritisation view. This enables users to prioritise targets based upon clinical precedence, tractability, doability and safety attributes. We have also implemented a direction of effect assessment for eight sources of target-disease association evidence, showing the effect of genetic variation on the function of a target is associated with risk or protection for a trait to inform on potential mechanisms of modulation suitable for disease treatment. These enhancements and the introduction of new back and front-end technologies to support them have increased the impact and usability of our resource within the drug discovery community.},

The most prevalent genes somatically altered in metastatic cancer included TP53, CDKN2A, PTEN, PIK3CA, and RB1. Putative pathogenic germline variants were present in 12.2% of cases of which 75% were related to defects in DNA repair.

  abstract        = {Identifying genetic biomarkers of patient survival remains a major goal of large-scale cancer profiling studies. Using gene expression data to predict the outcome of a patient's tumor makes biomarker discovery a compelling tool for improving patient care. As genomic technologies expand, multiple data types may serve as informative biomarkers, and bioinformatic strategies have evolved around these different applications. For categorical variables such as a gene's mutation status, biomarker identification to predict survival time is straightforward. However, for continuous variables like gene expression, the available methods generate highly-variable results, and studies on best practices are lacking. We investigated the performance of eight methods that deal specifically with continuous data. K-means, Cox regression, concordance index, D-index, 25th-75th percentile split, median-split, distribution-based splitting, and KaplanScan were applied to four RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets from the Cancer Genome Atlas. The reliability of the eight methods was assessed by splitting each dataset into two groups and comparing the overlap of the results. Gene sets that had been identified from the literature for a specific tumor type served as positive controls to assess the accuracy of each biomarker using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Artificial RNA-Seq data were generated to test the robustness of these methods under fixed levels of gene expression noise. Our results show that methods based on dichotomizing tend to have consistently poor performance while C-index, D-index, and k-means perform well in most settings. Overall, the Cox regression method had the strongest performance based on tests of accuracy, reliability, and robustness.},

Currently, such information is manually curated from the literature, obtained from high-throughput microscopy-based screens and predicted from primary sequence. To get a comprehensive view of the localization of a protein, it is thus necessary to consult multiple databases and prediction tools. To address this, we present the COMPARTMENTS resource, which integrates all sources listed above as well as the results of automatic text mining. The resource is automatically kept up to date with source databases, and all localization evidence is mapped onto common protein identifiers and Gene Ontology terms. We further assign confidence scores to the localization evidence to facilitate comparison of different types and sources of evidence. To further improve the comparability, we assign confidence scores based on the type and source of the localization evidence. Finally, we visualize the unified localization evidence for a protein on a schematic cell to provide a simple overview. Database URL: http://compartments.jensenlab.org.},

Here, we introduce Harmonizome 3.0, a significant upgrade to the original Harmonizome database. The upgrade adds 26 datasets that contribute nearly 12 million associations between genes and various attribute types such as cells and tissues, diseases, and pathways. The upgrade has a dataset crossing feature to identify gene modules that are shared across datasets. To further explain significantly high gene set overlap between dataset pairs, a large language model (LLM) composes a paragraph that speculates about the reasons behind the high overlap. The upgrade also adds more data formats and visualization options. Datasets are downloadable as knowledge graph (KG) assertions and visualized with Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) plots. The KG assertions can be explored via a user interface that visualizes gene-attribute associations as ball-and-stick diagrams. Overall, Harmonizome 3.0 is a rich resource of processed omics datasets that are provided in several AI-ready formats. Harmonizome 3.0 is available at https://maayanlab.cloud/Harmonizome/.},

The initial GDC dataset include genomic, epigenomic, proteomic, clinical and other data from the NCI TCGA and TARGET programs. Data production for the GDC started in June, 2015 using an OpenStack-based private cloud. By June of 2016, the GDC had analyzed more than 50,000 raw sequencing data inputs, as well as multiple other data types. Using the latest human genome reference build GRCh38, the GDC generated a variety of data types from aligned reads to somatic mutations, gene expression, miRNA expression, DNA methylation status, and copy number variation. In this paper, we describe the pipelines and workflows used to process and harmonize the data in the GDC. The generated data, as well as the original input files from TCGA and TARGET, are available for download and exploratory analysis at the GDC Data Portal and Legacy Archive ( https://gdc.cancer.gov/ ).},

They also have a strong influence on the genomic analysis of tumour samples, and may alter the biological interpretation of results. Here we present a systematic analysis using different measurement modalities of tumour purity in >10,000 samples across 21 cancer types from the Cancer Genome Atlas. Patients are stratified according to clinical features in an attempt to detect clinical differences driven by purity levels. We demonstrate the confounding effect of tumour purity on correlating and clustering tumours with transcriptomics data. Finally, using a differential expression method that accounts for tumour purity, we find an immunotherapy gene signature in several cancer types that is not detected by traditional differential expression analyses.},

Unlike traditional machine learning metrics, this novel enrichment-based metric is specifically designed to evaluate correlation data and provides valuable RNA-level interpretability. CorrAdjust outperforms current state-of-the-art methods when evaluated on 25 063 human RNA-seq datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas, the Genotype-Tissue Expression project, and the Geuvadis collection. In particular, CorrAdjust excels at integrating small RNA and mRNA sequencing data, significantly enhancing the enrichment of experimentally validated miRNA targets among negatively correlated miRNA-mRNA pairs.

We show the broader applicability of our constructed special histologic type gene signatures in the TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas dataset with a predictive model that detects mucinous histologic type across cancers of other organ systems. Using a normal mammary cell differentiation score analysis, we order histologic types into a continuum from stem cell-like to luminal progenitor-like to mature luminal-like. Finally, we classify TCGA-BRCA into 12 consensus groups based on integrated genomic and histological features.

A crucial aspect of ADC research involves the identification of optimal surface antigens that can effectively differentiate target cells from most mammalian cell types. Herein, we have devised an algorithm and compiled an extensive dataset annotating cell membrane proteins. This dataset is derived from comprehensive transcriptomic, proteomic, and genomic data encompassing 19 types of solid cancer as well as normal tissues. The aim is to uncover potential therapeutic surface antigens for precise ADC targeting. The resulting target landscape comprises 165 combinations of targets and indications, along with 75 candidates of cell surface proteins. Notably, 35 of these candidates possess characteristics suitable for ADC targeting, and have not been previously reported in ADC research and development. Additionally, we have identified a total of 159 ADCs from a pool of 760 clinical trials. Of these, 72 ADCs are presently undergoing interventional evaluation for a variety of solid cancer types, targeting 36 unique antigens. We conducted an analysis of their expression in normal tissues using this comprehensive annotation dataset, revealing a diverse range of profiles for the current ADC targets. Moreover, we emphasize that the biological impacts of target antigens have the potential to enhance their clinical effectiveness. We propose a comprehensive assessment of the drugability of target antigens, considering multiple facets. This study represents a thorough exploration of pan-cancer ADC targets over the past two decades, underscoring the potential of a comprehensive solid cancer target atlas to broaden the scope of ADC therapies.},

  abstract        = {Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a promising class of targeted cancer therapeutics. Further refinements are essential to unlock their full potential, which is currently limited by a lack of validated targets and payloads. Essential aspects of developing effective ADCs involve the identification of surface antigens, ideally distinguishing target tumor cells from healthy types, uniformly expressed, accompanied by a high potency payload capable of selective targeting. In this study, we integrated transcriptomics, proteomics, immunohistochemistry and cell surface membrane datasets from Human Protein Atlas, Xenabrowser and Gene Expression Omnibus utilizing Lantern Pharma's proprietary AI platform Response Algorithm for Drug positioning and Rescue (RADR®). We used this in combination with evidence based filtering to identify ADC targets with improved tumor selectivity. Our analysis identified a set of 82 targets and a total of 290 target indication combinations for effective tumor targeting. We evaluated the impact of tumor mutations on target expression levels by querying 416 genes in the TCGA mutation database against 22 tumor subtypes. Additionally, we assembled a catalog of compounds to identify potential payloads using the NCI-Developmental Therapeutics Program. Our payload mining strategy classified 729 compounds into three subclasses based on GI50 values spanning from pM to 10 nM range, in combination with sensitivity patterns across 9 different cancer indications. Our results identified a diverse range of both targets and payloads, that can serve to facilitate multiple choices for precise ADC targeting. We propose an initial approach to identify suitable target-indication-payload combinations, serving as a valuable starting point for development of future ADC candidates.},

While many different methods of measuring tissue specificity have been proposed and used for such studies, there has been no comparison or benchmarking of these methods to our knowledge, and little justification of their use. In this study, we compare nine measures of tissue specificity. Most methods were established for ESTs and microarrays, and several were later adapted to RNA-seq. We analyse their capacity to distinguish gene categories, their robustness to the choice and number of tissues used and their capture of evolutionary conservation signal.},

Despite this biomedical relevance, there has been no comprehensive assessment of the human surfaceome, and only a fraction of the predicted 5,000 human transmembrane proteins have been shown to be located at the plasma membrane. To enable analysis of the human surfaceome, we developed the surfaceome predictor SURFY, based on machine learning. As a training set, we used experimentally verified high-confidence cell-surface proteins from the Cell Surface Protein Atlas (CSPA) and trained a random forest classifier on 131 features per protein and, specifically, per topological domain. SURFY was used to predict a human surfaceome of 2,886 proteins with an accuracy of 93.5%, which shows excellent overlap with known cell-surface protein classes (i.e., receptors). In deposited mRNA data, we found that between 543 and 1,100 surfaceome genes were expressed in cancer cell lines and maximally 1,700 surfaceome genes were expressed in embryonic stem cells and derivative lines. Thus, the surfaceome diversity depends on cell type and appears to be more dynamic than the nonsurface proteome. To make the predicted surfaceome readily accessible to the research community, we provide visualization tools for intuitive interrogation (wlab.ethz.ch/surfaceome). The in silico surfaceome enables the filtering of data generated by multiomics screens and supports the elucidation of the surfaceome nanoscale organization.},

  abstract        = {Understanding dysregulated genes and pathways in cancer is critical for precision oncology. Integrating mass spectrometry-based proteomic data with transcriptomic data presents unique opportunities for systematic analyses of dysregulated genes and pathways in pan-cancer. Here, we compiled a comprehensive set of datasets, encompassing proteomic data from 2404 samples and transcriptomic data from 7752 samples across 13 cancer types. Comparisons between normal or adjacent normal tissues and tumor tissues identified several dysregulated pathways including mRNA splicing, interferon pathway, fatty acid metabolism, and complement coagulation cascade in pan-cancer. Additionally, pan-cancer upregulated and downregulated genes (PCUGs and PCDGs) were also identified. Notably, RRM2 and ADH1B, two genes which belong to PCUGs and PCDGs, respectively, were identified as robust pan-cancer diagnostic biomarkers. TNM stage-based comparisons revealed dysregulated genes and biological pathways involved in cancer progression, among which the dysregulation of complement coagulation cascade and epithelial-mesenchymal transition are frequent in multiple types of cancers. A group of pan-cancer continuously upregulated and downregulated proteins in different tumor stages (PCCUPs and PCCDPs) were identified. We further constructed prognostic risk stratification models for corresponding cancer types based on dysregulated genes, which effectively predict the prognosis for patients with these cancers. Drug prediction based on PCUGs and PCDGs as well as PCCUPs and PCCDPs revealed that small molecule inhibitors targeting CDK, HDAC, MEK, JAK, PI3K, and others might be effective treatments for pan-cancer, thereby supporting drug repurposing. We also developed web tools for cancer diagnosis, pathologic stage assessment, and risk evaluation. Overall, this study highlights the power of combining proteomic and transcriptomic data to identify valuable diagnostic and prognostic markers as well as drug targets and treatments for cancer.},

With recent technological advances and the urgent need to understand the effects of COVID-19, the proteomic analysis of blood-derived serum and plasma has become even more important for studying human biology and pathophysiology. Here we provide views and perspectives about technological developments and possible clinical applications that use mass-spectrometry(MS)- or affinity-based methods. We discuss examples where plasma proteomics contributed valuable insights into SARS-CoV-2 infections, aging, and hemostasis and the opportunities offered by combining proteomics with genetic data. As a contribution to the Human Proteome Organization (HUPO) Human Plasma Proteome Project (HPPP), we present the Human Plasma PeptideAtlas build 2021-07 that comprises 4395 canonical and 1482 additional nonredundant human proteins detected in 240 MS-based experiments. In addition, we report the new Human Extracellular Vesicle PeptideAtlas 2021-06, which comprises five studies and 2757 canonical proteins detected in extracellular vesicles circulating in blood, of which 74% (2047) are in common with the plasma PeptideAtlas. Our overview summarizes the recent advances, impactful applications, and ongoing challenges for translating plasma proteomics into utility for precision medicine.},

The uniform data reprocessing, quality scoring, and integrated orthology relations have made PaxDb one of the preferred tools for comparisons between individual datasets, tissues, or organisms. In describing the latest version 5.0 of PaxDb, we particularly emphasize the data integration from various types of raw data and how we expanded the number of organisms and tissue groups as well as the proteome coverage. The current collection of PaxDb includes 831 original datasets from 170 species, including 22 Archaea, 81 Bacteria, and 67 Eukaryota. Apart from detailing the data update, we also present a comparative analysis of the human proteome subset of PaxDb against the two most widely used human proteome data resources: Human Protein Atlas and Genotype-Tissue Expression.

A lack of large proteomic datasets has restricted the identification of new cancer biomarkers. Here, proteomes of 949 cancer cell lines across 28 tissue types are analyzed by mass spectrometry. Deploying a workflow to quantify 8,498 proteins, these data capture evidence of cell-type and post-transcriptional modifications. Integrating multi-omics, drug response, and CRISPR-Cas9 gene essentiality screens with a deep learning-based pipeline reveals thousands of protein biomarkers of cancer vulnerabilities that are not significant at the transcript level. The power of the proteome to predict drug response is very similar to that of the transcriptome. Further, random downsampling to only 1,500 proteins has limited impact on predictive power, consistent with protein networks being highly connected and co-regulated.

  abstract     = {Protein copy numbers constrain systems-level properties of regulatory networks, but absolute proteomic data remain scarce compared to transcriptomics obtained by RNA sequencing. We addressed this persistent gap by relating mRNA to protein statistically using best-available data from quantitative proteomics-transcriptomics for 4366 genes in 369 cell lines. The approach starts with a central estimate of protein copy number and hierarchically appends mRNA-protein and mRNA-mRNA dependencies to define an optimal gene-specific model that links mRNAs to protein. For dozens of independent cell lines and primary prostate samples, these protein inferences from mRNA outmatch stringent null models, a count-based protein-abundance repository, and empirical protein-to-mRNA ratios. The optimal mRNA-to-protein relationships capture biological processes along with hundreds of known protein-protein interaction complexes, suggesting mechanistic relationships are embedded. We use the method to estimate viral-receptor abundances of CD55-CXADR from human heart transcriptomes and build 1489 systems-biology models of coxsackievirus B3 infection susceptibility. When applied to 796 RNA sequencing profiles of breast cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas, inferred copy-number estimates collectively reclassify 26% of Luminal A and 29% of Luminal B tumors. Protein-based reassignments strongly involve a pharmacologic target for luminal breast cancer (CDK4) and an α-catenin that is often undetectable at the mRNA level (CTTNA2). Thus, by adopting a gene-centered perspective of mRNA-protein covariation across different biological contexts, we achieve accuracies comparable to the technical reproducibility limits of contemporary proteomics. The collection of gene-specific models is assembled as a web tool for users seeking mRNA-guided predictions of absolute protein abundance (http://janeslab.shinyapps.io/Pinferna).},

Proteomics data from CPTAC tumor types have been primarily generated using a multiplex tandem mass tag (TMT) approach, which is designed to provide protein quantification relative to reference samples. However, relative protein expression data are suboptimal for prioritization of targets within a tissue type, which requires additional reprocessing of the original proteomics data to derive absolute quantitation estimation. We evaluated the feasibility of using differential protein analysis coupled with intensity-based absolute quantification (iBAQ) to identify tumor-enriched and highly expressed cell surface antigens, employing tandem mass tag (TMT) proteomics data from CPTAC. Absolute quantification derived from TMT proteomics data was highly correlated with that of label-free proteomics data from the CPTAC colon adenocarcinoma cohort, which contains proteomics data measured by both approaches. We validated the TMT-iBAQ approach by comparing the iBAQ value to the receptor density value of HER2 and TROP2 measured by flow cytometry in about 30 selected breast and lung cancer cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia. Collections of these tumor-enriched and highly expressed cell surface antigens could serve as a valuable resource for the development of cancer therapeutics, including antibody-drug conjugates and immunotherapeutic agents.},

To get the best out of all these alternatives, we need to integrate their results in an unbiased manner. Prioritized gene lists are a common result presentation method in genomic data analysis applications. Thus, the rank aggregation methods can become a useful and general solution for the integration task. Standard rank aggregation methods are often ill-suited for biological settings where the gene lists are inherently noisy. As a remedy, we propose a novel robust rank aggregation (RRA) method. Our method detects genes that are ranked consistently better than expected under null hypothesis of uncorrelated inputs and assigns a significance score for each gene. The underlying probabilistic model makes the algorithm parameter free and robust to outliers, noise and errors. Significance scores also provide a rigorous way to keep only the statistically relevant genes in the final list. These properties make our approach robust and compelling for many settings. All the methods are implemented as a GNU R package RobustRankAggreg, freely available at the Comprehensive R Archive Network http://cran.r-project.org/.},

Together with other high-throughput technologies, such as microarrays, there are an enormous amount of resources in databases.

For instance, the aims of RNA-seq studies often coincide with those of differential gene expression experiments based on microarrays. As such, it would be logical to utilize all available data. However, there is a lack of biostatistical tools for the integration of results obtained from different technologies. Although diverse technological platforms produce different raw data, one commonality for experiments with the same goal is that all the outcomes can be transformed into a platform-independent data format - rankings - for the same set of items. Here we present the R package TopKLists, which allows for statistical inference on the lengths of informative (top-k) partial lists, for stochastic aggregation of full or partial lists, and for graphical exploration of the input and consolidated output. A graphical user interface has also been implemented for providing access to the underlying algorithms.

Rank aggregation techniques offer a general and flexible framework that allows one to objectively perform the necessary aggregation. With the rapid growth of high-throughput genomic and proteomic studies, the potential utility of rank aggregation in the context of meta-analysis becomes even more apparent. One of the major strengths of rank-based aggregation is the ability to combine lists coming from different sources and platforms, for example different microarray chips, which may or may not be directly comparable otherwise. The RankAggreg package provides two methods for combining the ordered lists: the Cross-Entropy method and the Genetic Algorithm. Two examples of rank aggregation using the package are given in the manuscript: one in the context of clustering based on gene expression, and the other one in the context of meta-analysis of prostate cancer microarray experiments. The two examples described in the manuscript clearly show the utility of the RankAggreg package in the current bioinformatics context where ordered lists are routinely produced as a result of modern high-throughput technologies.},

  abstract        = {The availability of proteomics datasets in the public domain, and in the PRIDE database, in particular, has increased dramatically in recent years. This unprecedented large-scale availability of data provides an opportunity for combined analyses of datasets to get organism-wide protein abundance data in a consistent manner. We have reanalyzed 24 public proteomics datasets from healthy human individuals to assess baseline protein abundance in 31 organs. We defined tissue as a distinct functional or structural region within an organ. Overall, the aggregated dataset contains 67 healthy tissues, corresponding to 3,119 mass spectrometry runs covering 498 samples from 489 individuals. We compared protein abundances between different organs and studied the distribution of proteins across these organs. We also compared the results with data generated in analogous studies. Additionally, we performed gene ontology and pathway-enrichment analyses to identify organ-specific enriched biological processes and pathways. As a key point, we have integrated the protein abundance results into the resource Expression Atlas, where they can be accessed and visualized either individually or together with gene expression data coming from transcriptomics datasets. We believe this is a good mechanism to make proteomics data more accessible for life scientists.},

Sex, age and genetic factors are associated with variation in protein abundance. In total, 1981 cis-protein quantitative trait loci (cis-pQTL) are identified, of which a majority of protein targets have not been assayed in the recent plasma-based proteogenomic studies. Integrating transcriptomic information from matching tissues delineates concordant as well as discordant expression patterns at RNA and protein levels. Juxtaposition of data from different tissues indicates both shared and tissue-specific genetic architecture that underlie protein abundance. Complementing genomic annotation, RNA-based eQTL studies, as well as the recent establishment of plasma-based proteogenomic characterization, tissue-pQTLs shed light on biology underlying genotype-phenotype association of complex traits and diseases.},

We quantified the relative protein levels from over 12,000 genes across 32 normal human tissues. Tissue-specific or tissue-enriched proteins were identified and compared to transcriptome data. Many ubiquitous transcripts are found to encode tissue-specific proteins. Discordance of RNA and protein enrichment revealed potential sites of synthesis and action of secreted proteins. The tissue-specific distribution of proteins also provides an in-depth view of complex biological events that require the interplay of multiple tissues. Most importantly, our study demonstrated that protein tissue-enrichment information can explain phenotypes of genetic diseases, which cannot be obtained by transcript information alone. Overall, our results demonstrate how understanding protein levels can provide insights into regulation, secretome, metabolism, and human diseases.},

  abstract        = {Proteomics captures the biological and functional state of cells, condensing complex molecular information into quantitative measurements, yet the reuse of public mass spectrometry (MS) data is impeded by heterogeneous processing and incomplete metadata, limiting its potential to generate new biological insights. These issues restrict reproducibility and cross-study integration, underscoring the need for standardized, high-coverage reference resources. PaxDb addresses this by providing a protein abundance reference at organism- and tissue-level, for the healthy, wild-type state. The v6.0 release integrates 1639 datasets from 392 species, nearly doubling coverage since v5.0, with expanded representation across all kingdoms of life. A new end-to-end MS data processing pipeline enables consistent re-analysis from raw files using the FragPipe framework, integrating standardized metadata, orthology mappings, and protein-protein interaction-based quality scoring. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale, unbiased, automated reprocessing of public MS data, including links to metadata. We further developed large-language model ensemble classifiers to semi-automate the curator-selection of relevant ProteomeXchange (PX) projects, as well as a user-facing tool for peptide-level abundance calculation, dataset scoring, and direct comparison with PaxDb reference data. The updated database is available at https://www.pax-db.org.},
